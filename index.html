              My name is Lily Winderl. I am an art student at the University of Montana in Missoula. My concentrations are in Ceramics, Graphic Design, Art History and Museum Studies. I took this class in Web Design to add another skill to my media tool bag as well as to supplement my degree. This page is a little introduction to what I've learned. Everything you see I have coded and typed up myself. I hope you enjoy!

            <h3 id="facts"> What I've learned about Web Design:</h3>
          <p> While enrolled in this web design class I've learned that web design is very complex. I have learned how to communicate with the computer using the languages of html and CSS. It has all been very straightforward. The thing you have to remember most is to use your punctuations, brackets, and tags properly. You have to always remember to make each element with the proper tags such as the ones used for this paragraph, "< p >,< / p >" or your code will not work. </p>
